                This main page shows off some news for you as a student and pictures/things we do at Yearbook. This is
                all in an effort to show you that we are hard at work and try to bring out only the best of what we can
                do. <br />

                            This is the Yearbook class where we actually do work. (Mrs. Lamb's room)
                            It isn't a big place, but it has just enough space/what we need to do our job.
