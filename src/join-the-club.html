                    Joining this club is not an easy task, so you might need to understand that quickly. But first,
                    you'll need to know something before hand. This club actually counts as a class! So it's not just a
                    club that you can join and leave at any time. (besides, that wouldn't be fair to Mrs. Lamb) You need
                    to (when possible) see if you are eligible for joining the class by not only getting in contact with
                    Mrs. Lamb by either emailing her, (which you can do so by clicking:
                    <a href="mailto:slamb@g.omaksd.org" style="color: black">slamb@g.omaksd.org</a>) or by going
                    arranging a meeting time to talk about joining the club. (this might also need to be done via
                    email.)
