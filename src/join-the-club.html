                    <!--How to Join the Club.-->
                    <td style="border:solid; border-color:black"><p>Before you join, you need to know something. Yearbook, isn't just a club, (we just like calling it a club) it's an actual class. A class that you would need to actually go an write down that "I want to join this class/club".</p>

                    <p>You also need to remember, that just because this is a class, you really shouldn't just join the class, then leave the class after your first few assignments. (that's not fair to Mrs. Lamb you know?)</p>

                    <p>When you've decided that you wanna be a part of the team, you'll need to go over some things. Please read through the "What we Expect/Require" to figure out what you need to do to join. Once all of that is done, you can start thinking of your eligibility to join the class. You would need to run a few things. Is the teacher accepting students? Is the school okay with you transferring classes this early/late? and lastly, are you ready?</p>

                    <p>To start, you would need to check if Mrs. Lamb is accepting students, you can do so by emailing her at this email (clicking on it will take you to an emailing platform of your choice): <a href="mailto:slamb@g.omaksd.org" style="color:black; text-decoration: underline;">slamb@g.omaksd.org</a></p>

                    <p>After checking in with Mrs. Lamb, you would need to ask the school itself if you're good to join the class by transferring classes. Now, I would give you an email here, but if I remember anything about this school, (because im new here) it's kinda like my old school, everyone has their own counselors given to them by their last name? (might be wrong, just what my old school did.) You should now understand why I wouldn't be able to put an email for you to use. In long story short, your gonna need to figure that one out.</p>

                    <!--What we Do.-->
                    <td style="border:solid; border-color:black"><p>Here in Yearbook, you would never believe it, but we need to <strong>take pictures.</strong> (shocking right?) Always be prepared, as when you get assigned a page/thing to work on, it might require you to go out and take pictures.</p>
                    
                    <p>In Yearbook, we design pages for... the Yearbook. (cool right?) We need these pages done by a deadline set by the one and only, Mrs. Lamb! Although I'm talking a lot about picture taking, we do more than that believe it or not! We need to do other things like edit the taken photos, peer review each others things (peer as in whole class), work with partners on pages, help other Yearbook members and advertise the Yearbook itself by creating things like drawing, or designs.</p>

                    <p>By the few days I've been here, I have learned there actually is a lot more than just taking pictures and whatnot. (I'm just forgetting most of them) Some of these things which we are doing (at the time of writing this website) is painting! This painting is for the advertisement I mentioned earlier. We also have (if im remembering correctly) an "Omak Yearbook Instagram Account", where we post photos of whats going on in Yearbook, and more advertisements there on making sure people buy their Yearbook</p>

                    <p>Although I'm new here, you wouldn't believe how much I've learned here purely just because of the Yearbook class. So if you're also one of those people new here, or just someone who wants to meet new people, walk around and take pictures, Yearbook is definitely for you then, and I recommend taking it when you can. <br>

                    <!--What we Expect/Require.-->
                    <td style="border:solid; border-color:black">
                        <p>This is where you'll learn what we expect from you at the Yearbook when the time comes. You'll need to learn a few things when getting into the Yearbook class, like learning the cameras you'll be handling, the type of style the Yearbook goes with for that year, how to actually use what editor they use for posting and designing the Yearbook.</p>

                        <p>The Yearbook class requires some skills that not a lot of people have. Now, these skills can either be perfect for you, or it's something your not good with/at. One of these skills are dependent on your ability to socialize, and to talk to others. Take it from me, the kid who moved here almost (at the time of writing) a few months ago, that this yearbook class has been an absolute test on my social skills, mainly because you shouldn't be afraid to ask people to pose in certain ways for the picture you want.</p>

                        <p>Some other skills required for this job is being able to co-operate with others, direct things how you want them, ask for help when needed, and in vice versa, help others when they need it! These skills are the same type of skills you would say you have on a resume, or any other type of job application. Think of the skills you need at Yearbook, as the ones you need at a job.</p>

                        <p>One of the other <strong>MAJOR</strong> skills you will need to posses, is the ability to take critique on your work and dish it back out. This is because, if you read some of the "What we Do", you'll know that we do peer reviews, (as a class) and this is your/others chance to point out mistakes on each others work, to fix them. That way, when the Yearbook is finished, and everything is given to the public, the pages don't contain many errors that will stay there permanently.</p>
