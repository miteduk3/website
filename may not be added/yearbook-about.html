Dustin Surface
<td style="border:solid 5px black;">
    <h2>Dustin Surface</h2>
    <img src="Dustin.png" style="width:300px; height:300px;">
    <p>Dustin didn't have too much to say during our interview, 
    but I still ended up getting some good stuff for his page!</p>

    <p>Dustin said that he likes Yearbook, because he gets to watch people make new memories.
    He enjoys this because he also likes capturing those moments for him to remember later.
    </p>

    <p>Dustin doesn't go by a quote or have a good short description like some others, 
    but when asked an outstanding question, Dustin was able to deduce
    that he would be --on an average day-- able to cary 5 pigeons. (not a bad number)</p>

Shayawna Carden
<td style="border:solid 5px black;">
    <h2>Shayawna Carden</h2>
    <img src="Shayawna.png" style="width:300px; height:300px">
    <p>Shayawna says she likes Yearbook because of the community you get to create in the class itself and that it helps her get involved with other people in the school.</p>

    <p>Shayawna describes herself as a kind, funny and very outspoken person, who likes talking to people. (Depending on how annoying they are) (told me not to add that, but I did it anyway!)</p>

    <p>A quote she either goes by, or enjoys is: "I can't go back to yesterday, because I was a different person then." - Lewis Carroll</p>

Wayne Land
<td style="border:solid 5px black;">
<h2>Wayne Land</h2>
<img src="Wayne.png" style="width:300px; height:300px">

<p>Wayne's advice to someone starting Yearbook would be to not stress about the deadlines, 
and to just have fun with whatever it is your working on.
</p>

<p>While Wayne doesn't have a short description about himself, 
he does have a quote from a good movie.
"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your going to get." - Forrest Gump
</p>

<p>Wayne also believes that on an average day, he could reasonably "about 25".
And finally, when asked to add anything else, he added: "Yes."

Mrs. Lamb
<td style="border:solid 5px black">
<h2>Mrs. Lamb</h2>
<img src="yearbook-icon-small.png" style="width:300px; height:300px">

<p>Mrs. Lamb likes Yearbook because she likes that its a co-operative, teamwork based class.
    She also likes that there are so many skills that are used when making a Yearbook, that there will definitely be something for everyone.
</p>

<p>While Mrs. Lamb may not have a short description about herself,
    but she does have a quote that I think I've only heard once, that quote being:
    "To have friends, one must be friendly." - Proverbs 18:24
</p>

<p>Finally, when asked, Mrs. Lamb (who absolutely <strong>despises</strong> pigeons)
    believes she would be able to hold--with a glove on--one in each hand. 
    And when asked to add anything else, she replied with: "I love Yearbook students." (how sweet)

Lillyian (no last name)
<td style="border:solid 5px black">
<img src="yearbook-icon-small.png" style="width:300px; height:300px">
<h2>Lillyian</h2>
<p>Lillyian likes Yearbook, because it gets you out of your comfort zone and you get to meet a lot of people while doing interviews or taking pictures.</p>

<p>Lillyian's short description, describes her saying that she "Doesn't ride horses", was an actor for 1 year, has been working since she was 16 and like a resume, says she is a hard worker, reliable, and good with people. (she also said something about being a fairy princess... not sure what thats about)</p>

<p>Lillyian goes by a single quote said by a great man: "I am easily influenced by music" - Peter Griffin <br>
    When lillyian was asked: "How much sawdust can you put into a rice krispie treat before others start noticing?" she responded with: "I feel like you could easily put two and a half cups, but just have to be really good at gaslighting someone that its normal."
</p>

<p>Finally, when asked to add anything else, she responded with: "KT 4 life."</p>

Cheyenne Hamm

<h2>Cheyenne Hamm</h2>
<img src="Cheyenne.png" style="width:300px; height:300px">

<p>Cheyenne agree's with what Katianna's advice is, 
    and also believes you should keep an open mind to creativity, and to also be creative.</p>

<p>Cheyenne's short description is that she's this year's drama club president (written in 2024) 
    and also ASB's secretary for the junior class.</p>

<p>Cheyenne goes by a quote said by a (I hope) good guy: "You wont fail, if you never try." - Cheyenne's dad.
    And when asked 
    "How much sawdust could you put in a rice krispie treat before others start noticing?" 
    she believes "about a handful".

Kyle Rider
<td style="border:solid 5px black">
<h2>Kyle Rider</h2>
<img src="Kyle.png" style="width:300px; height:300px">
<p>Kyle's advice to a new person would be to go to as many events as possible for pictures because it not only gets the pictures out of the way, it helps improve your grade more than anything else you can do in the class.</p>

<p>Kyle's description of himself is that he's the President of Yearbook, President of Link Crew, Team Captain for the Cross-Country and Track & Field team and most importantly, a Member of HOPE squad, which I wrote down next to it: "(very important)"</p>

<p>Kyle follows a quote by a weird name: "Strive for wisdom! Or at least a decrease in idiocy." - Angela of Many Names. 
    He was unfortunately not asked the pigeon or sawdust question, but when asked if he wanted to add anything else, he says: "Yearbook was a lot of fun, definitely worth doing".

Katianna Long
<td style="border:solid 5px black">
    <h2>Katianna Long</h2>
    <img src="yearbook-icon-small.png" style="width:300px; height:300px">
    <p>Katianna's advice to someone who's just starting, is to be creative and keep an open mind. If you don't come with an open mind and are not ready to learn anything? Yearbook would not be the best for you. She also believes that if your interested in journaling stuff, its a good choice to join. (it's also good to put on your resumes!)</p>

    <p>While Katianna doesn't have a quote to go by, her short description is that she rides horses, and has raised a horse since it was a baby. When asked to add anything else, she responded with: "Lils 4 life."</p>
